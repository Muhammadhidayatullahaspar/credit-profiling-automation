# Credit Profiling System Automation using UiPath and Flask Machine Learning

This project aims to automate the credit profiling system by leveraging UiPath for deployment and Flask Machine Learning for classification. The system allows users to submit an Excel file containing credit history information to a web deployment. The web application then performs credit classification, determining whether the credit is good or bad. The automation robot retrieves this information and writes it back to the Excel file. Additionally, the robot prompts the user for an email address to send the machine learning results.

## Features
- Automated credit profiling system using UiPath and Flask Machine Learning
- Seamless integration with Excel for data manipulation
- Web deployment for easy user interaction and credit classification
- Efficient classification of credit as good or bad based on historical data
- Email notification feature to deliver machine learning results

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/credit-profiling-system.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up the UiPath automation environment (provide necessary instructions if applicable)
4. Start the Flask application: `python app.py`
5. Access the web interface in your preferred browser: `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage
1. Upload the Excel file containing credit history data through the web interface.
2. The system will classify the credit as good or bad based on machine learning algorithms.
3. The robot will retrieve the classification results and update the Excel file with the corresponding information.
4. Provide your email address when prompted by the robot to receive the machine learning results.
5. Check your email for the classification report.
